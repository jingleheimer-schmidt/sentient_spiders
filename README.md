---------------------
# Overview
Kick that raw fish into overdrive and give spidertrons a little sentience, as a treat.

Spidertrons automatically follow their last driver.
Idle spidertrons wander around the factory.

---------------------
# Features

- When a player exits a spidertron, the spidertron will automatically follow the player.
- When a player enters a vehicle, any spidertrons following the player will automatically follow the vehicle.
- When a spidertron is not following anything, it will wander around inspecting the factory.
- When a spidertron is stuck trying to reach a wayponit, it will attempt to modify its own path to find a way around the obstacle.
- Includes an interface so that other mods can add their spidertrons to the ignore list if desired.
